## Insurance claims analysis and prediction

#### Task description:
***
The goal is to analyze and create a PoC which predicts if a customer makes an insurance claim. Paying out when a customer makes one is by a substantial margin the biggest cost to any insurer, so itâ€™s important the policies are priced sufficiently highly to cover this cost. However, charging too much will result in customers taking their business elsewhere. Being able to differentiate between high- and low-risk customers allows for applying adequate policies to customers. In order to do so, machine learning models were created which predict how probable it is for a customer to make a claim based on their driving style and characteristics. 

#### Task approach:
***
- Understanding and analysis of the original dataset
- Visualization of the most important findings
- Preprocessing before modelling
- Modelling
- Evaluation

#### Data:
***
Each row in the dataset corresponds to a customer/policy, the outcome column corresponds to whether they made a claim or not, and the other columns describe the customer, their vehicle or their driving style. Most of the columns are self-explanatory, but noting additionally that: DUI means Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol, telematic_score is a driving score created with help of telematics devices mounted in vehicles.
